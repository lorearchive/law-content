====== Guide to Contributing ======
Helping out the wiki shouldn't be a daunting task. That is why I'll try to make everything easy.

<callout type="info" icon="true">  
Every usage manual of the Lore Archive are editable by the public, just likes its wiki content and everything else. If you can see a way to improve anything on this document, please read our guide on "Contributing on GitHub", which can be found below.

===== Contributing on GitHub =====

[[https://github.com|GitHub]] is a place where programmers can store their code and collaborate with others on it. It makes tracking changes and storing past versions very easy, and that is why I have chosen GitHub as the primary collaboration point. The [[https://www.dokuwiki.org|wiki engine]] of the Lore Archive Wiki does support collaboration natively, however I thought taking the necessary security measures and preventing vandalisms and all sorts of other configuration was unnecessary.

The raw contents of the wiki are stored in a **GitHub Repository**. A repository, or repo for short, is basically a project, a bundle of code. Inside the repo is where you'll find all of the raw wiki content, organized by folders, which is the GitHub equivalent for namespaces.

Your contributions/edits to the raw content of the wiki can be categorized into three different types of edits - a **minor edit**, a **medium edit**, or a **major/substantial edit**.

==== Minor Edit ====

A minor edit is an edit like a quick fix. Such as fixing typos, adding/deleting a sentence or two, adding/deleting a paragraph.

Adding references to a [ciation needed] tag, adding/deleting footnotes, adding/deleting a link, transferring an already written bit of text into a callout are all counted as minor edits.

Basically, anything you think is a minor edit, probably will be a minor edit.

This is how a minor edit is suggested on GitHub.

If you find something you wish to edit, have a look at the page ID of the page you want to edit. You can look at the URL bar to find the page ID.

Then, locate that file in the GitHub repo. After clicking into that .txt file, you will be able to see the raw version. On the top right of the code, you will see a button with a pencil icon. That is the edit button.

  - Fork \\ When you click on that pencil button, you will be prompted to "fork" the repository to propose changes. A fork is basically your own a copy of the repository. Everything is the same. After forking the repository, you can make your edits there. \\ \\
  - Commit \\ When you are done with your changes, you'll see a green button that says "Commit changes...". You can think of a commit is essentially the same as a save. So when you commit the changes, you save the changes. In the commit message, you can write a brief description of the changes you have created. \\ \\
  - Pull Request (PR) \\ After you saved your commit, you can create a Pull Request or a PR. This is essentially "uploading" your changes onto the original repository you forked from. Give it a fitting title, add a description if required, then create a PR. \\ \\
  - Await for merge \\ Congratulations! You just submitted a change to the wiki. Once I see it and verify it, I can "merge" your changes with the original raw content, and update the wiki! Until then, it will stay open in the Pull Requests tab.

That seemed overwhelming for a minor edit, but really, all you did was:
  - Copy the raw wiki content
  - Save the raw wiki content changes
  - Upload for review
Really, that is all you did.


===== Style Guide =====
At the end of each articles, you will find these sections:

  *References
    *Sources
  *See also
  *Further reading

The "References" section is where any inline citations go. The "Sources" section includes links to pages which have been sourced to create the article. Keep in mind that the Lore Archive Wiki //archives// lore from all around the internet, therefore where you sourced it from makes sense to go here. "See also" includes internal pages which are related to the topic, and "Further reading" generally includes external websites and artilcles which are related to the topic that the reader may find interesting.

===== Syntax Guide =====

You can format your text using wiki markup. This wiki markup rule will be referred to as "syntax".

The syntax of the Lore Archive Wiki is a superset of the default [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/wiki:syntax|DokuWiki syntax]], which aims to make the datafiles as readable as possible. You should at least familiarize yourself with the basic syntax if you want to provide some kind of medium to substantial edits for the wiki. It will provide great aid in your writings and will improve boring-looking articles.

Whenever you forget your basic syntax, you can refer to this [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/cheatsheet|cheatsheet]].

==== Core Syntax ====
The Core Syntax is syntax provided by the wiki engine the Lore Archive Wiki uses, called [[https://www.dokuwiki.org|Dokuwiki]].

=== Utility ===
== Heading ==
<code>
====== Heading 1 ====== (Only used as the first heading of a page)
===== Heading 2 =====
==== Heading 3 ===
=== Heading 4 ===
== Heading 5 ==
</code>

You should at least separate the heading from the preceding section with a line.

^          Do This!          ^         Not This.         ^
|  <code>Some text in a section.

=== Heading ===

Blah Blah Blah
</code>|<code>
Some text in a section.
=== Heading ===

Man I Love Frogs
</code>|

You can either start the section one line under the heading or right under the heading.

However, if the preceding section does not have any content, you may write the heading write under the heading.
<code>
=== A heading without content ===
== Right underneath ==
</code>


== Citations ==

<code>
This is a ciation[(Citation!)], called a note.

You can give it a name[(later>For later!)], and refer to the same note again[(later)].
</code>

This is a ciation[(Citation!)], called a note.

You can give it a name[(later>For later!)], and refer to the same note again[(later)].

This is how you would add an inline [[:citation|citation]] in the Lore Archive Wiki.


== Escape Wikisyntax ==

<code>
<nowiki>Escaped **wikisyntax**</nowiki>
</code>

<nowiki>Escaped **wikisyntax**</nowiki>


== A FIXME Bookmark ==
''%%FIXME%%'' creates a Fix Me! emoticon, and it is a good bookmark to use when you find something which should be fixed. This is generally done by me in the pre-release phase.


=== General ===
== Inline Emphasis ==
<code>
**Bold**
//Italic//
__Underline__
**//Bold & Italic//**
**//__Everything Everywhere__//**

<del>Deleted</del> (This is a strikethrough)
</code>

Italics are most commonly used for story names. E.g. "As mentioned in the /Basking in the Brilliance of Their Serenade/ Story, Hina seems to..." Otherwise, use them as emphasis.

You can use strikethrough when an information was true in the past, but not anymore currently, either in real life or in the Blue Archive universe. In that case, you draw an arrow to show direction of change. It can also be used to add informal humorous takes on a topic.


== Inline ==

<code>
Paragraphs are created automatically

from blank lines. If you want to force a newline, use \\ for a linebreak.
</code>

Paragraphs are created automatically

from blank lines. If you want to force a newline, use \\ for a linebreak.

You can use this if you want to write information horizontally on the datafile, but you want it rendered vertically.


<code>
((Footnotes are enclosed between two pairs of parantheses.))

If the footnote comes mid sentence, it should stick to the word((Like this.)) preceding the footnote. If it comes after a comma,((Like this.)) it should stick right behind the comma.
</code>

Treat the contents inside the footnotes like its own piece of paragraph. Begin it with a capital letter, end it with a full stop. If the footnote comes mid sentence, it should stick to the word preceding the footnote. If it comes after a comma, it should stick right behind the comma (applies to full stops also). Try not to start a sentence with a footnote.



=== Advanced ===

== External links ==
<code>
External links are recognized automagically: http://www.google.com or simply www.google.com

You can set link text as well: [[http://www.google.com|This Link points to google]]. Email addresses like this one: <cirrow@proton.me> are recognized, too.
</code>

External links are most often used to link other websites which have been sourced by the Lore Archive Wiki. You should always wrap the links between two brackets ''%%[[]]%%'' regardless of link text. If possible, always provide link text also.


== Internal links ==
Internal links are also created by using square brackets.

<code>
You can either just give a [[:pagename]] or use an additional [[:pagename|link text]]. Some pages may have [[:namespace:page]]. You can also link to a specific [[:page#headingid|Heading]], too.
</code>

All internal links should begin with a colon (:). A colon is a namespace separator in DokuWiki, and starting a link with the colon sets the link up for absolute pathing, instead of a relative one. E.g. if the current page is inside the namespace "gehenna", and inside is a link like this: ''%%[[somepage]]%%'' you will be linked to a page with the absolute path of: ''%%[[:gehenna:somepage]]%%''.

Make sure all links are lowercase.

You should link to relevant wiki pages when it is mentioned in the article for the first time. Even if there are multiple mentions, refrain from linking every one of them. You may link an already-linked page only after a significant amount of text later. You can also use them to link to a page which you imply. E.g. you can link to a specific school when the article mentions "a school".


== Interwiki links ==
<code>
DokuWiki supports [[doku>Interwiki]] links. These are quick links to other Wikis.

For example this is a link to Wikipedia's page about Wikis: [[wp>Wiki]].
</code>

For example this is a link to Wikipedia's page about Wikis: [[wp>Wiki]].


Really the most used interwiki link is the link to Wikipedia. Simply begin by writing ''%%[[wp>%%'' followed by the article ID of Wikipedia. You would want to use custom link text if the Wikipedia ID contains underscores.

You can get Wikipedia's page id by looking at the URL. For example, Blue Archive's Wikipedia page has the URL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Archive, which means the page ID is ''%%Blue_Archive%%''.

== Images ==
''%%{{:path:to:image.png}}%%'' creates images. Use flags delimited by ''%%?%%'' for further customization.

For example, you can set a custom width using ''%%{{:path:to:image.png?400}}%%'' which outputs an image at 400px width.

By using whitespaces you can either align the image on the left, middle, or right. 

^            Aligned to left           ^             Aligned to middle          ^            Aligned to right          ^
| ''%%{{:path:to:image.png?400  }}%%'' | ''%%{{  :path:to:image.png?400  }}%%'' |  ''%%{{  :path:to:image.png?400}}%%'' |


By default, it is justified.

You can also set an image as a link. Simply put an image as the link text: ''%%[[:link|{{:image.png}}]]%%''

When aligning an image, you can use one space, but **you should use two spaces** instead for compatibility and readability.


== Tables ==
Enclose table headers between carats (^), cells between pipes ( | ). For more information, check the [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/wiki:syntax#tables|official documentation]].

You can use this anytime when you require a two-dimensionally structured data.

== Unordered Lists ==
<code>
  * Begin with two spaces and an asterisk
    * A deeper level has four spaces then an asterisk
</code>

== Ordered Lists ==
<code>
  - This time, two spaces and a hyphen.
    - Otherwise, it is pretty much the same.
</code>

Generally, you should have a space after the list character (* or - ). 

== Text to HTML characters ==
<code>
-> <- <-> => <= <=> >> << -- ---
</code>

-> <- <-> => <= <=> >> << -- ---

-> is normally used to represent a time direction (refer to the deleted syntax section), <- is normally used on the top of pages if they "go back" to a main page, sort of like a pagination.



==== Extended Syntax ====
The Extended Syntax consists of syntax provided by third party [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins|DokuWiki Plugins]] to extend the functionalities of the default core syntax further. All syntax you will need are given below, and some plugins are created by myself. You can check its source code, alongside other plugins that are not created by me that I have modified, on the [[https://github.com/lorearchive/extensions/tree/main|GitHub repository]].


=== Third-party plugin syntax ===
== Figures & Captions ==

Simply enclose the image within a pair of square brackets like so: ''%%[{{:path:to:image.png|Caption goes here.}}]%%''. It behaves just like an image, and is capable of being aligned, resized, etc. Links are recognized in the caption too.

If the image is sourced from third-party websites, e.g. not official Blue Archive illustrations, make sure to source it by creating a link within the figure caption with the link text "Source" and by linking that text to the source of the image.

Figures and captions are best used aligned to the right at under 400px width. It is used alongside the main article content to provide graphical cues aided by text to give a visual description on a topic of discussion.


== Callouts ==
''%%<callout>Hello!</callout>%%'' renders a default callout.

You can customise the callout by adding attributes. You can give it a specific color by setting a type attribute. For example, ''%%<callout type="info">Hello!</callout>%%'' creates a callout with a light blue color.

The types you can use are: primary, secondary, success, info, warning, and danger. You should also set ''%%icon="true"%%'' which will render icons too, unless if doing so will make the callout look cluttered.

Callouts highlight information that pops out and is clearly visible from the rest of the article. It is primarily used as an info callout to provide further information on an article's topic of discussion. You can really use a callout anywhere you see fit.

== Blockquotes ==
<code>
<blockquote>//What is Michael Jackson's favourite pass-time? \\ \\ ...Ski-he!//</blockquote>
</code>

Sorry about that disastrous joke. But note the italics which enclose the quote.

You can set who said it, like this: ''%%<blockquote footer="Michael Jackson">//He-he!//</blockquote>%%''

You can italicize a portion of the footer text. Simply write what you want italicized in the "cite" parameter: ''%%<blockquote footer="Michael Jackson, Source" cite="Source">//Ow!//</blockquote>%%''

<blockquote footer="Michael Jackson, Source" cite="Source">//Ow!//</blockquote>

You should always enclose the quoted portion in italics. Because it is a quote. It looks better that way.

When someone said something in an official Blue Archive story, write their name, and italicize where it came from.

<code>
<blockquote footer="Yurizono Seia, Main Story, Volume 3, Chapter 1, Episode 1" cite="Main Story, Volume 3, Chapter 1, Episode 1">
</code>


== Pseudo-HTML tables (Ad-Hoc Tables) ==
Use standard HTML tags to create tables. For custom parameters, enclose them between square brackets. For more information, check the [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:adhoctables|official documentation]].

Generally you should use the basic table syntax unless you require substantial styling.


=== Lore Archive's custom syntax ===

  *Ciation needed

''%%(((cn)))%%'' renders a [citation needed] tag. You can read more about it in the [[:citation|citations information page]] on the wiki itself.

You should add a ciation needed tag on a claim that has been made which seems like it has been sourced from the official stories of Blue Archive. You can also help out and find the reference and cite it yourself.

  *Notifications
''%%(((NotificationType|Date)))%%'' renders a notification. You can read more about it on the "Learn how and when to remove this message" link.

Example: ''%%(((citation|Date)))%%'' renders:

(((citation|Date)))

They act like Wikipedia templates, and you should add them if the page or an article section contains room for improvement, errors, or points which should be fixed.

There are currently these different notification types:

  *citation - for a citation notification
  *wording - for a awkward wording notification
  *discussions - for a discussion citation notification
  *more - for a more info needed notification
  *unfinished - for an unfinished article notification

  *HTML <div>
''%%<division>%%'' generates an HTML ''%%<div>%%'' tag. Everything else is the same. Note that the Lore Archive Wiki supports [[https://getbootstrap.com/|Bootstrap 5.3.3]], so you can use its classes.


  *Custom external links
External links by DokuWiki does not support formatting inside it. You can use ''%%[h[%%'' and ''%%]h]%%'' to generate hyperlinks which have formatting in them.

<code>
[h[www.google.com|Google **link!**]h]
</code>

[h[www.google.com|Google **link!**]h]
